Luminous Intervention Slides

Layers on-the-fly slides with a web-based interface.



Installation Instructions:

  STEP 1: Requirements

    In order to install this software, you will need an *AMP installation.

    For Windows, install something like http://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/

    For OSX, install something like http://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/

    For *NIX systems (easiest), install a LAMP system - for Ubuntu, this is done with the instructions here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu
    
    This system also requires a laptop with a dual-monitor setup - that is, the laptop screen and projector output are not the same.
    
    Finally, this system requires cookies to be enabled on your browser.

  STEP 2: Extraction
    
    Extract the li_slides.zip package to your HTML directory in your *AMP installation
    
  STEP 3: Database
    
    Using a tool like http://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/ , import the li_slides.sql db into its own schema
    
    In the directory you extracted into in step 2, go to ./li_slides/sites/default/settings.php - edit this file to match your mysql username, db name, and password
  


Usage instructions

  STEP 1: Log in

    Navigate your browser to "localhost/li_slides" - you should see your installation up and running now. Login with the credentials admin/blockthexl
  
  STEP 2: Find or create your presentation. 
  
    If you are doing the Keystone XL demonstration, an existing presentation is set up for you already. It should be listed on the homepage.
    
    If you are doing another presentation, you can click "Content > Add Content > Stream Presentation" to create a new one
    
  STEP 3: Add slides
  
    You should see a link to add a "+ New Slide" - click this and enter the text, set up the font and positioning, etc.
    
    Once you create a slide, you can click Edit to edit or delete it.
  
  STEP 4: Open presentation
  
    Click the "Open Stream" button, which should open a presentation in a new browser tab. This is the tab that you will open as a full-size window (F11 on Chrome & Firefox) on your projector.
    
  STEP 5: Select layers
    
    Back on the laptop, select the two layers to display by clicking on the "Layer 1" and "Layer 2" links. You should see them pop up on the projector.
    


Enjoy!
